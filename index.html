              About Me
            </h2>
            <p>I was employed with Beach Head which is a Japanese company who manage client’s inventory stocks and websites in Michigan, Here I picked up skills in MY SQL and PHP. I was also an Intern at Millenium solution focus where I picked up my skills in C#, SQL, and Asp.net. These experiences improved my skills as a application developer. I also previously worked at UPS as an application developer associate and assisted the user with any issues and tested programs.  
            I attended William Paterson University where I earned my BA in Computer Science and Japanese.
